## [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)

This is the main one. It includes:

- GitHub Pro
- Free domain names for a year
- $200 USD in [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) credit for a year
- [JetBrains Free Educational Licences](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students) (see below)

- Various other free tools and services

## [JetBrains Free Educational Licences](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students)

Free licences for [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) IDEs ([IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/), [etc](https://www.jetbrains.com/products/)) for non-commercial use. Seriously, these IDEs are great (albeit more complex than VS Code). Redeemable separately or through the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack).

## [Microsoft Azure for Students](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/)

$100 USD in Azure credit per year plus some additional free services. Redeemable separately or through the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack). Make sure to use a personal Microsoft account instead of your university account.

Free ARM cloud VMs (up to 4 cores and 24 GB of RAM total) indefinitely (even after you graduate), $300 USD credit to use in the first month, plus some additional free services. Credit card required, but you won't get billed for overage unless you explicitly upgrade to paid.

## [Google Cloud Free Tier](https://cloud.google.com/free)

$300 USD of credits for 3 months plus some additional free services. Credit card required, but you won't get billed for overage unless you explicitly upgrade to paid.

## [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free)

Free trials of services plus some free services. Credit card required, and **usage beyond the Free Tier will be billed** (and **it's quite easy to accidentally rack up a bill if you're not careful**, so consider yourself warned).
